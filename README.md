## 🏆 Basic dashboard exercice  

#### 🎯 Goal

The goal of this app was to build a small e-commerce dashboard from sample order transactions in CSV. 
The dashboard is based off a web page that a user can visit and interact with. 

The page has two blocks:

##### 1. Summary view
This block display the three following metrics:
- Total revenue
- Average revenue per order
- Number of unique customers

##### 2. Monthly view
This block has a graph showing the evolution of total revenue by month.


The entire dashboard ban be filtered by `Country` (but also by `All`, for a global overview).

#### 🎁 Bonus 

I might add a more dynamic DB (SQL) and an API in the next future.
